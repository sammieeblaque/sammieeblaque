# Hey, I'm Samuel 👋

**Fullstack Engineer** building products that solve real problems.

I work on fintech and healthcare platforms, specializing in scalable systems that handle real user problems—from international payments to HIPAA-compliant healthcare applications. I believe in shipping quality code that's maintainable, well-tested, and actually solves the problems it's supposed to solve.

## What I Build 🚀

**Current Focus:**
- Fintech infrastructure for cross-border payments and compliance
- Dynamic, config-driven systems that scale without code changes
- Full-stack features from database design to user interface

## Tech I Work With 💻

**Frontend:** React, Vue.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, React Native  
**Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, Express.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, AWS, GCP, CI/CD (GitLab, CircleCI)

## Things I've Shipped 📦

- **International payment systems** handling multiple currencies with 97%+ success rates
- **HIPAA-compliant healthcare platforms** with end-to-end encryption
- **Dynamic form renderers** that scale across countries without engineering effort
- **Multi-tenant SaaS platforms** serving thousands of users
- **Mobile apps** with 4+ star ratings on app stores
- **Role-based permission systems** controlling access across entire platforms

## What Gets Me Excited 🔥

- Building systems that scale without breaking
- Creating developer experiences that don't suck
- Turning complex business requirements into simple, maintainable code
- Performance optimization (Redis caching, API latency, that kind of thing)
- Writing tests that actually catch bugs (85%+ coverage where it matters)
- Config-driven architecture that puts power in non-technical hands

## Open to Collaborating On 🤝

- **React/Vue projects** - Especially if they involve complex state management or performance challenges
- **Node.js backends** - NestJS and Express.js are my jam
- **Fintech or healthcare** - I've shipped in both industries and understand the compliance requirements
- **Developer tools** - Always interested in building things that make developers' lives easier
- **Open source** - If you're working on something interesting, let's talk

## Recent Wins 🏆

- Reduced onboarding processes from weeks to days through automation
- Built compliance systems scaling across multiple countries
- Shipped MVPs that secured first paying customers
- Architected permission systems used by thousands of users daily

## How I Think About Code 💭

I believe in:
- **Pragmatic architecture** - Use the right tool for the job, not the trendy one
- **Readable over clever** - Your code should explain itself
- **Testing what matters** - Not chasing 100% coverage, but covering critical paths
- **Iteration over perfection** - Ship, learn, improve
- **Documentation** - Future you (and your teammates) will thank you
- **Empowering non-technical teams** - Good systems reduce engineering bottlenecks

## Fun Facts About Me 🎯

- I've shipped production code in React, Vue, and React Native
- Started with electrical engineering, now I engineer software
- Based in Abuja, Nigeria 🇳🇬
- I think Redux Toolkit is underrated and everyone should use RTK Query
- My debugging strategy: console.log everywhere, then clean it up (we've all been there)
- Believe in building systems that shift control from engineers to business teams
